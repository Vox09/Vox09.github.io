<blockquote>
<p>Good farming news may harm farmers:</p>

<li>Supply shifts right, demand remain the same, elasticity greater than 1, total revenue decrease.</li>
</ul>
<p>OPEC fall to keep oil price high:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supply is elastic over long period. Curve becomes flatter and flatter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Drug interdiction may increase drug-related crime:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supply shifts left, demand remain the same, elasticity less than 1, total revenue increase. Instead, to avoid drug-related crime, we should spend resource on demand side, like drug education.</li>

<ol type="1">
<li><strong>oligopoly</strong>: a market with only a few sellers, each offering a product that is similar or identical to the products offered by other sellers in the market.
<ul>
<li>Economists measure a market's domination by a small number of firms with a statistic called the <em>concentration ratio</em>, which is the percentage of total output in the market supplied by the four largest firms.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>monopolistic competition</strong>: a market structure in which many firms sell products that are similar but not identical. Attributes:
<ul>
<li><em>Many sellers</em>: There are many firms competing for the same group of customers,</li>
<li><em>Product differentiation</em>: Each firm produces a product that is at least slightly different from those of other firms. Thus, rather than being a price taker, each firm faces a downward-sloping demand curve.</li>
<li><em>Free entry and exit</em>: Firms can enter or exit the market without restriction. Thus, the numbers of firms in the market adjusts until economic profits are driven to zero.</li>

<h2 id="competition-with-differentiated-products">Competition with Differentiated Products</h2>
<p>To understand monopolistically competitive markets, there are four aspects. ### Firm in the Short Run</p>
<p>A firm chooses its quantity and price just as monopoly does. The quantity is at which MR = MC and then use demand curve to find the price.</p>
<h3 id="long-run-equilibrium">Long Run Equilibrium</h3>
<p>Profit encourage entry and loss encourage exit. Finally the demand curve and ATC curve is tangent at the quantity where MR curve intersects MC. - as in a monopoly market, price exceeds MC. - as in a competitive market, price equals ATC.</p>
<h3 id="monopolistic-vs-perfect-competition">Monopolistic vs Perfect Competition</h3>
<p>Two noteworthy differences. 1. Excess Capacity Perfectly competitive firms produce at the efficient scale,whereas monopolistically competitive firms produce below this level, called to have excess capacity under monopolistic competition. 2. Markup over Marginal Cost The difference between the price and the MR=MC point.</p>
<h3 id="the-welfare-of-society">the Welfare of Society</h3>
<p>One source of inefficiency is the markup of price over MC. Thus, a monopolistically competitive market has the normal deadweight loss of monopoly pricing.</p>
<p>Another way is the externalities associated with entry. - The product-variety externality: Because consumers get some consumer surplus from the introduction of a new product, entry of a new firm conveys a positive externality on consumers. - The business-stealing externality: Because other firms lose customers and profits from the entry of a new competitor, entry of a new firm imposes a negative externality on existing firms.</p>
<p>In the end, we can conclude only that monopolistically competitive markets do not have all the desirable welfare properties of perfectly competitive markets. That is, the invisible hand does not ensure that total surplus is maximized under monopolistic competition. Yet because the inefficiencies are subtle, hard to measure, and hard to fix, there is no easy way for public policy to improve the market outcome.</p>

<li>Competition

<p>Oligopolists would like to form cartels and earn monopoly profits, but that is often impossible, prohibited by antitrust laws.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nash equilibrium</strong> A situation in which economic actors interacting with one another each choose their best strategy given the strategies that all the other actors have chosen.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>When firms in an oligopoly individually choose production to maximize profit, they produce a quantity if output greater than the level produced by monopoly and less than the level produced bu perfect competition. The oligopoly price is less than the monopoly price but greater than the competitive price(which equals marginal cost).</em></p>
<p><em>As the number of sellers in an oligopoly grows larger, an oligopolistic market looks more and more like a competitive market. The price approaches marginal cost, and the quantity produced approaches the socially efficient level.</em></p>
