# Shortest Paths

All algorithms, except **Dijkstra**, allow **negative weights**, 
but there can *NOT* be **negative cycle**. 



## Bellman-Ford Algorithm



## Dijkstra Algorithm

*NOT* allow **negative** weights.

## Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

All-pairs shortest paths



# Flow

## Ford Fulkerson Algorithm
