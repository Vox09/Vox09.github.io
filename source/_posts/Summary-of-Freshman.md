As the first post of the **life** blog, it's written at the end of the semester, which proves the good saying that an end is a brand new begin.

## Overview

  Time flies. Now I have finished my first year of university, exactly, a quarter of my whole uniersity. I truly learn a lot of things during the one year. However, I don't earn a good grade as I used to suppose. That's why I think I should make some changes. 

## Academic
  I got a very low CGA in the first semster due to an copy issue. I originally thought I would work hard this semester but it proved to be not. Everyday I just sleep till waking up naturally if there is no required 9:00am class. Oversleep is quite bad for both my health and mental state. **I should set up a clock.** 

  As for final period, it's the most important time if you want to get a good grade. I should have entered study model early but not. Finally found that MATH1014 has a lot of practices to do but I'm lazy, so I protracted till the day before exam. Then after MATH1014, I found PHYS1112 is not that easy too. But I am already exhausted then, so I even didn't finish the past paper. Though doing past paper may not be necessary but instead of doing PP, I did nothing. My final score of PHYS1112 is just 32/45. There is no possibility that I can get A+. I don't know whether I can make an A. These stuff is due to most absence of classes in this semester, and also the contempt of exam.

  There is no use to state either the reason or the excuse of my bad grade. The solution is to make changes. **I must make a schedule next sem, to regulate my life.**

## Tech

  This topic is most of my interest. 
  I learn python, C, Linux foundation at first semester.
  And ROS, Gazebo, Chibi OS, Kali, Hexo, Vim at second semester.

  It looks like that I truly spend a lot of time on tech and no wonder to get a bad grade...That is not the true reason actually.
  Dad said it's important to keep the balance between tech and academics, which I strongly agree. However, in fact, I can not raise my interest in academics as much as tech. To find out its cause, I think tech is useful and I can use them to do some exact things, but academics is not and I don't know its usage due to my ignorance. But nowadays I feel some MATH course content interesting, which is quite a good tend. 

## END
There are still many things I do not cover in this post, but I do not want to haver any more. Because I'm hungry now and I want to have dinner. U see, my lifestyle is in a mess now...I think writing all these shit makes me feel better now, so I need to do my proper business now.
