# Origin
  Today is not a special day. However, if you make a decision to start doing something special from this day, it will become a special day.

## Motivation
  Sometimes we need to calm down and think about what's going on, especially in the exploring world now. Too many interruptions are around us, making us busy and muddleheaded.
  So writing is quite a good way to meditate. It talks to our heart, like a mirror, to reflect on ourselves. It records our feelings, like a root, to give us courage to advance. 

## Target
  *Compliants are never the solutions.* By writing the facts down, I want to discover some problems that was not noticed then and trying to correct them. *Problem is always the most important.* Now I alreay have the courage and passion to solve porblems, the only thing remaining is to discover them.
